                <h1> <strong>About Me</strong></h1>

                <p>
                    My name is Alex Jenkins and I am attending UNC Charlotte Bootcamp.
                    Before I decided to make a career
                    change
                    I was in the hospitality industry for 14 years. I attended culinary school in 2008 and moved to
                    Charleston, South Carolina.
                    He I worked for some of the top chefs in the country, and became a sous chef at Oak Steakhouse
                    Charleston. I then was
                    Offered to open an Oak Steakhouse in Charlotte, where I was the Executive Chef. After my second year
                    here my wife and I
                    gave birth to my daugher Emily and she changed my life. I ended up transistioning into the
                    healthcare
                    kitchen sector where hours
                    were better and more sutiable for family friendly hours. I have always loved technology and
                    computers
                    and it was a moment I was
                    at my brothers house he had his screen up with his work. Instanly I became drawn to it and it was in
                    that momemnet I knew I
                    wanted to learn code and transistion into the technology field.
