            <p>
                My name is Alex Jenkins and I am attending UNC Charlotte Bootcamp. 
                Before I decided to make a career
                change
                I was in the hospitality industry for 14 years. I attended culinary school in 2008 and moved to
                Charleston, South Carolina.
                He I worked for some of the top chefs in the country, and became a sous chef at Oak Steakhouse
                Charleston. I then was
                Offered to open an Oak Steakhouse in Charlotte, where I was the Executive Chef. After my second year
                here my wife and I
                gave birth to my daugher Emily and she changed my life. I ended up transistioning into the healthcare
                kitchen sector where hours
                were better and more sutiable for family friendly hours. I have always loved technology and computers
                and it was a moment I was
                at my brothers house he had his screen up with his work. Instanly I became drawn to it and it was in
                that momemnet I knew I
                wanted to learn code and transistion into the technology field.
